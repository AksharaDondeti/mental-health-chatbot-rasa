    - text : "The Guest House–Rumi 
              This being human is a guest house.
              Every morning a new arrival.
              
              A joy, a depression, a meanness,
              some momentary awareness comes
              as an unexpected visitor.
              
              Welcome and entertain them all!
              Even if they’re a crowd of sorrows,
              who violently sweep your house
              empty of its furniture,
              still, treat each guest honorably.
              He may be clearing you out
              for some new delight.
              
              The dark thought, the shame, the malice,
              meet them at the door laughing,
              and invite them in.
              
              Be grateful for whoever comes,
              because each has been sent
              as a guide from beyond.
              
              “The Guest House” by Rumi is a profound poem that uses the metaphor of a guest house to describe the human experience. It suggests that we should welcome all emotions, whether positive or negative, as they are all part of being human. Each emotion is seen as a visitor, teaching us something valuable about ourselves and life. By embracing them, we can learn and grow from the experiences they bring. The poem encourages acceptance, openness, and the understanding that even challenging emotions have a purpose in shaping our journey 🏡💭🌱"

In a city where it was easy to feel lost and alone, Aria was a beacon of light, spreading kindness and compassion wherever she went.\nAs the years passed, Aria's efforts began to bear fruit. She watched with pride as her community came together to support one another, bridging the gaps between race, gender, and socioeconomic status. And though the work was far from over, Aria knew that she had played a part in creating a city where everyone felt seen, heard, and valued.\nThrough her strength, resilience, and unwavering empathy, Aria showed the world that even in the midst of chaos, there was always room for kindness, compassion, and positive change.
